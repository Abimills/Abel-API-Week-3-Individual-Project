# Abel-API-Week-3-Individual-Project



This repository is an hyf individual project for the using Api module.
This project is meant to focus on manipulating apis and learning
 more about them along the way.

In this particular individual project I have decided to make a food ordering website which depends on 
('https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?i=chicken_breast') food api for the data.

I have made this file structure :


└── public
index.html

└── src
app.js
style.css

└── pages
home.js
categorieMenu.js
navabr.js
service.js
about.js
