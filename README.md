# Abel-API-Week-3-Individual-Project



This repository is an hyf individual project for the using Api module.
This project is meant to focus on manipulating apis and learning
 more about them along the way.

In this particular individual project I have decided to make a food ordering website which depends on 
('https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?i=chicken_breast') food api for the data.

I have made this file structure :


└── public
index.html

└── src
app.js
style.css

└── pages
home.js
categorieMenu.js
navabr.js
service.js
about.js

the pages of the web app are as folows:

. home.js :  home page for the app/ you can search and order your food there.

. CategorieMenu.js : is another way of ordering/ you can choose diffrent types of food categories and 
order there. everytime you order you will have a pop up message indicating what you just ordered.
. Navbar.js - is incharge of the navbar which is always fixed at the top and helps you navigate between pages..
.Cantact.js - is a contact page for complaint and support but it doesnt really send a complaint..justed added it to make the website look cool.
about.js - is resposible for about us section of the web page...
